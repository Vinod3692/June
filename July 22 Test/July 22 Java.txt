6.Method parameters are variables mainly used in the method body to pass the values inside the class.

7.compile time polymorphism is achieved through a mechanism called as generics,
  this allow to write code that can be work with different types at compile time.
  Example:- public class Example {

     	public int add(int a, int b)
	{
        return a + b;
    	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example example= new Example();
        int output= example(5,10);
        System.out.println("output of add(5,10):"+output);
	}
	}
8.Var-args is known as the variable length arguments and that allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments of the same type.

9.package is represented as the folder and which is created in the format of reverse domain
	The import types are:
	1.Implict
	2.Explict 

10.Constructor chaining is defined as the one constructor can be called in the another constructor within the same class.
class Car{
void Car(String name){
system.out.println(name);
}
void Car(int model{
}
public static void main(string[] args){
Car car=new Car();
car.name="Shift";
car.model=2018;
system.out.println("the car name is ");
system.out.println("the car model is ");
}
}

11.class Chair{
public static int Chair(int n) {
if (n <= 0) {
return 0;
}
else {
return Chair(n - 1);
}}
public static void main(String[] args) {
int n = 10; 
System.out.println("Fibonacci number" + n + " is: " + Chair(n));
}}
